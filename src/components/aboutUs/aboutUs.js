            <strong>What is GameVault?</strong> GameVault is a platform for
            logging, rating, and reviewing video games. It allows users to
            create personalized game lists, discover new titles, and share their
            gaming experiences with others.

          <p>
            <strong>Why I Created GameVault?</strong> As an avid gamer and web
            developer, I wanted a place where people like me could track the
            games they play, share opinions, and find new games based on
            personal taste. Inspired by platforms like MyAnimeList, I decided to
            create a similar community, but focused solely on video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Vision for the website?</strong> My goal with GameVault is
            to create a comprehensive, user-friendly platform where gamers can
            explore new games, rate and review titles, and connect with others
            who share similar interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Disclaimer!</strong> Not all features are implemented, and
            they will slowly be coming out, so stay tuned and happy gaming!
